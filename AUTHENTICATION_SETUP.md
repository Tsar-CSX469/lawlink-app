  - Email/password authentication
  - Google Sign-In integration
  - User data management in Firestore
  - Error handling

#### Screens
- `lib/screens/login_page.dart` - Beautiful login page with:
  - Email/password login

  - Authentication wrapper integration
  - New routes for auth pages
  - Profile and logout buttons in AppBar
  - Proper navigation handling

- `lib/firebase_options.dart` - Fixed Firebase configuration

## Features Implemented

### Authentication Flow
1. **Automatic Authentication Check**: App automatically checks if user is logged in
2. **Login/Register**: Users can create accounts with email/password or Google
3. **Google Sign-In**: One-click registration/login with Google account
4. **User Data Storage**: User information stored in Firestore
5. **Profile Management**: Users can view their profile information
6. **Secure Logout**: Proper sign-out from both Firebase and Google

### User Data Collection
When registering, the app collects:
- **Username** (for email/password registration)
- **Email** (from form or Google account)
- **Account creation timestamp**
- **Last login timestamp**

For Google Sign-In, it automatically uses:
- Display name from Google account as username
- Email from Google account

### Security Features
- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Email validation
- Error handling for common auth errors
- Secure token management through Firebase

## How to Use

### For Users
1. **First Time**: App opens to login page
2. **Register**: Click "Sign Up" to create account with email/password
3. **Google Sign-In**: Use "Continue with Google" button for quick setup
4. **Login**: Return users can log in with their credentials
5. **Profile**: Access profile via person icon in app bar
6. **Logout**: Use logout button in app bar

### For Development
- Authentication state is managed automatically
- User data is accessible via `AuthService`
- Routes handle authentication flow seamlessly
- Error messages are user-friendly

## Firebase Setup Required
Make sure your Firebase project has:
1. **Authentication enabled** with Email/Password and Google providers
2. **Firestore database** for user data storage
3. **Proper Google Sign-In configuration** in Firebase console

## Testing
The app has been analyzed and all major errors resolved. The authentication system is ready for testing on both email/password and Google Sign-In flows.
